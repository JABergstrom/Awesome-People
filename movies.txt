During my undergraduate studies at Bowling Green State University,
I had a major in Film Production. The year before I graduated, I
was able to study abroad for a semester in England. This trip
allowed me to attend the London Film Festival for a weekend. A more
file-name-relevant fact is that I have seen over 1,700 films in my
life (including 245 first-watches this year).
